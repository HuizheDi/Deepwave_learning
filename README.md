# Deepwave_learning

Deepwave implements wave propagators as PyTorch modules. This allows you to perform forward modelling, and backpropagation to calculate the gradient of the outputs with respect to the inputs (and thus perform inversion/optimisation). It currently includes regular and Born modelling of the scalar wave equation, and runs on both CPUs and GPUs.
